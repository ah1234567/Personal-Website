      <h3>Lab Analysis</h3>
      <p >Using both practical and theoretical expertise, I am able to develope chemical methods and products for  participants in the food sector.

I can create scalable processes for mass analysis of chemical components using process chemistry.

I  can colloborate  with engineers to ensure that upstream and downstream processes ran smoothly.

I can use Rotovaps, vacuum pumps, and sonicators were operated and maintained.</p>

      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>Chemical compounds are studied by research chemists, who then use their findings to develop and improve processes and products ranging from novel medications and medical treatments to manufactured goods such as cosmetics, electronics, and food and drink. The majority of research chemists will work in laboratories. Chemical biology, computational chemistry, green chemistry, materials chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, and synthesis are all possible research topics.</p>
